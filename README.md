# pinn_estimation
Official implementation of the paper "Sound Field Estimation around a Rigid Sphere with Physics-informed Neural Network".
[[arXiv](arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14013.pdf)]

##  Note
Here's a brief overview of the repository's structure:

- **dataset.py**: [Coming Soon] The `dataset.py` file will provide the necessary data preprocessing and loading functions. We are currently finalizing this part of the project and will upload it soon.

- **model.py**: This file contains the implementation of the learning model used in this project. It includes layers and the model architecture.

- **train.py**: [Coming Soon] We are actively working on the `train.py` file, which will contain the code for training the model using your dataset. Stay tuned for updates!
